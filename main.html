		<p> A computer is defined as a programmable device used to carry out arithmetic or logical operations. Computers are 
		able to solve multiple problems as these operations can be changed and altered to serve a specific purpose. </p>
		
		<h3> Code Systems </h3>
		<img  id ="environment" src ="http://www.proactiveinvestors.com/genera//img/companies/news/computer_code_350_51b0dc7f91da8.jpg"/>
		<p> Code systems are a systems of signals that represent letters and numbers, such as Morse code. Code systems are 
		often used in transmitting messages. In computers code systems are found as part of the computer program. </p>
		
		<h3> Binary Code </h5>
		<p> The binary code system is a low level language used by computers. It is a base 2 
		number system, meaning that it only uses two digits, 1 and 0. In this system each
		individual digit is called a bit and 8 bits are called a bite. To count in the binary system 
		the bit 0 is started with then proceeded with 1 before adding another bit. For example 
		the number 9 would be represented by 1001. </p>   
			
		<h3> Decimal Number System </h5> 
		<p> The decimal number system is the system most commonly used in mathematics 
		and everyday general life. This is a base 10 number system using the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 
		5, 6, 7, 8 and 9. </p>

		<h3> Hexadecimal Number System </h5>
		<p> The hexadecimal number system is a translation language between Binary and Decimal systems. It is a base 16 
		system that uses the digits 0 to 9, A, B, C, D, E and F.

		<h3> Programming Languages </h3> 
		<p> A programming language is a language made to give instructions to parts of computer hardware. Programming 
		languages are used to create programs that affects the computers behaviour, and expresses algorithms. Thousands 
		of different programming languages have been created and many more are being created every year. Common examples 
		of languages are JAVA, C, Perl and Python.
