		<p>Many of today'\s technologies have a large effect on the environment through their production, use and disposal. Despite 
		this many people believe the exact opposite. Computers are at least built to save paper right? In fact the opposite is true.
		In a study done by the United Nations 240 kilos of fossil fuels, 22 kilos of chemicals and 1,500 kilos of water are used in 
		the production of the average desktop computer. In addition to these, many hazardous wastes are used in the computers. 
		Examples of these are lead, arsenic, selenium, cadmium, cobalt and mercury, among others. After the short lifespan of 
		computers as a result of constantly updated technology these hazardous materials become very unsafe for  </p>

		<p> the environment. Over time in a landfill these materials contaminate our water supply, the plant environment and animals. 
		When we absorb these materials into our bodies devastating effects can take place.  However, new programs are being 
		put in place to recycle old computers in an environmentally friendly way. These programs are leading a wave of 
		environmental causes related to computers are helping to lessen the environmental burden caused by computers.

		<h3> Computer Ethics </h3>
		<img id = "ethics" src="http://www.secuproducts.nl/contents/pages/00001107/dief.jpg" />
		<p>Computer ethics are moral principles that govern and regulate the use of computers. Common areas of ethical conduct 
		include property rights, privacy concerns and how computers affect society. In the area of property rights copyright and 
		plagiarism takes effect. Proper credit must be given when material and information is taken from other authors. In an area 
		of privacy rights it is unethical to obtain personal data from computer sources. Websites are now required to provide a 
		legal privacy policy when obtaining any personal data. This policy outlines the way that a company, gathers, uses, and 
		discloses and managers a customerâ€™s information. As computer technology continues to advance however, the 
		discussion of how much influence computers have in of artificial intelligence, human communication and other areas 
		take place. As these and other issues arise the computer world will continue to create more ethics for this and other 
		new technologies.

		<h3> Health Issues Related to Computers </h3>
		<p> Computer have increasingly become a part of everyday life for those of us in the first world. In fact, a recent study 
		suggested that around 85 percent of Americans spend time each day on the computer. With this increase of computer 
		usage also comes a variety of both short and long term health problems for computer users. <br><br> One of 
		these main problems are sleep disorders caused from working in bed late at night or early in the morning. These habits 
		can cause insomnia or often awakening during the night. Sleeping disorders aren't the only type of health problems 
		caused by the working environment however. A variety of problems from head aches to back pain can come as a result of 
		surroundings. Lighting, screen position, chair position and even glasses can be the cause of these problems. To solve 
		these problems experts recommend frequent breaks about once every hour. They also recommend checking your posture 
		and the position of your keyboard and mouse to insure decrease health risks.
