		<h1> Hardware </h1>
		<img src= "https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTmg39KfKeupZNQsLcb2h-NpX61YbpbLosRgQDo6zLT1ely13rpEw" />
		<p> Computer hardware refers to the actual psychical components of a computer. Examples of computer hardware 
		include the mouse, keyboard, monitor, hard drive and motherboard. All of these components can be physically touched. 
		There are many different types of hardware that can be both inside and connected to the computer. 

		Below is a diagram of a desktop computer including the major internal parts. </p>

		<h3> Storage </h3>
		<img id = "storage" src= "http://www.digitaljournal.com/img/6/8/7/0/1/4/i/8/0/3/p-large/Data_Storage_Devices.jpg" />
		<p> Computer data storage provides a basic function of all computers, data retention. Data can be stored on a number 
		of different devices front hard disks, to memory sticks, to computer hardware. In most computers, combinations of 
		different devices are used to store data. </p>
		<h4> Hard Disks </h4>
		<p> Most computers have one or more disk drives. These disk drives read medal plated disks that can be used to store 
		music, photos, videos, software and documents. These disks are rapidly spinning and are read by a moving actuator 
		arm within the computer. The main advantage of disk drives is that they are relatively permanent and store data even 
		when the computer gets turned off. The other main advantage is that they are cheap to use and store data long term. 
		In this new age of technology however, hard disk drives are slowly becoming replaced by flash memory because of ease 
		of use. </p>
		<h4> Memory </h4>
		<p> Computer memory generally refers to the internal hardware within the computer that is used to store data. These 
		types of memory can generally be divided into two categories, primary memory and secondary memory. Primary memory 
		is faster but more expensive and is the main access point between memory and the central computer. The main device 
		used in primary memory is that Random Access Memory or RAM. This device, like all types of primary memory loose 
		data when the computer is turned off. Secondary memory on the other hand is slower and less expensive but is used for 
		the long term storage of data. This means that unlike primary storage, secondary storage doesn’t lose memory when the 
		device is turned off. Also unlike primary memory, secondary storage is not directly connected to the central computer. 
		Instead, the secondary storage is linked through primary storage. </p>
		<h4> Cloud Computing </h4>
		<p> Cloud computing is a type of networking in which network-based services are commonly used. The cloud uses 
		virtual hardware that does not affect the end user. In most cases third parties operate large data centers which can 
		be used to store files and other data objects. This data storage is then accessed over the internet and can be 
		seamlessly be accessed through multiple devices. Cloud computing is still in its early stages however companies like 
		Apple, Google and Amazon are already market leaders in this industry. </p>
		
		<h3> Processor </h3> 
		<p> The computer processor, formally called the Computer Processing Unit or CPU, is the hardware within a computer 
		that carries out the computer software’s instructions. It does this by carrying out basic logistical and arithmetical 
		operations. It is possible for a computer to have more than one processor, these computers are multiprocessing. Most 
		modern processors however only use one chip, this is called a microprocessor. If a computer does have more than one 
		chip however, it is called a multi-core processor.   </p>
		
		<h3> Peripherals </h3>
		<img id = "peripherals" src= "http://2.imimg.com/data2/LR/JP/MY-3321689/computer-peripheral-500x500.jpg" />
		<p> A peripheral is a device which is connected to a host computer for function. These devices aren’t part of the 
		computer but extend its capabilities. Peripherals can be broken down into three main types input, output and storage. 
		An input peripheral is used to interact with and send data to the computer. Two common examples are a mouse or a 
		keyboard. An output peripheral device is a device that is used to display data to the user, such as a monitor or printer. 
		The input and output to a computer is not limited to humans however, in many cases the input received by a computer 
		can be from another computer or other data device. One example of this is the computers interactions with the host 
		internet server. Finally, storage peripherals are the third type of peripheral devices and are used to store data from the 
		computer. This category includes flash drives and hard disks. </p>   
		
		<h3>Networking</h3>
		<p> A computer network uses telecommunications to transfer data between computers. In a network data can be shared 
		between computers and access to devices, such as a printer, as well as other resources. The most common network in 
		the world is the Internet. Other networks are used in large businesses as well as connecting personal computers in 
		homes. <br> <br> There are two main types of computer networks used for different purposes. The first type of network is a peer to peer 
		network and is commonly used in homes. In this network all of the computers are equal and are treated as their own 
		entities. In this network each of the computers are connected by a router. The computers share all of the resources 
		equally including printers, scanners, ect. <br> <br> The second type of network is mostly used in businesses and organizations. This type of network is called a 
		client-server network. The server computer controls the client computers and initiate all recourse flow. The client 
		computer controls the access to the other computers and controls their resources.
