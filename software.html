		<h1>Software </h1>
		<img src="http://readwrite.com/files/styles/630_0su/public/fields/app-icons-apple-app-store_0.jpg" />
		<p> Computer software is the non-physical component of the computer. All computer software or computer programs 
		are purely information that cannot be touched. The purpose of computer software is to give the <a href="hardware.html"> hardware </a> instructions on how to perform the tasks it was designed for. Examples of different types of software include 
		word processors, operating systems, file management programs and internet browsers.   </p>
		
		<h3> Operating Systems </h3>
		<img id = "peripherals" src=http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-AbcxqMJAgmc/UGC9UpTpZGI/AAAAAAAABM8/UXfXEkwSM6s/s1600/operatingsystem-system+software-computer-free-lessons.jpg" />
		<p> An Operating System or OS is a software program used to manage the computer\'s hardware and support the computer\'s 
		basic functions. The operating system acts as a layer between the hardware and computer applications. The operating system 
		takes care of basic functions such as input, output and memory allocation. Computer applications require an operating system 
		to run and to communicate between the application and the hardware. Operating systems are found in any device containing a
		computer such as tablets, cell phones, video game consoles and web servers. <br> <br> Common examples of operating 
		systems include Mac’s OS X for computers or iOS for cell phones, Microsoft Windows, Blackberry OS, and Android. The 
		ancestor of most modern day operating systems is Unix. Most successful, modern day operating systems, with the 
		exception of Windows have derived from Unix based code.  Unix, without a doubt, has been influential in every modern 
		day operating system.
		</p>
		
		<h3> Applications </h3> 
		<p> An application is a type of computer software that runs on a computer to perform a useful task. The application itself 
		runs over top of the operating system or system software. Applications can be created to perform many different tasks 
		such as word processing, gaming, business software, graphics software, media players and office suites. In todays age 
		applications can be created for a number of different devices besides computers. Devices such as smartphones, tablets 
		and laptops. <br> <br> Overall the different types of applications can be broken down and categorized in many different ways. 
		One of the main ways is by the type of applications however applications can also be categorized by web applications 
		and web-native applications. Web applications often require internet access to run and are written in HTML, Java or 
		CSS. Web-native applications however use languages available on the users computer and don’t use the internet. 
		Thirdly, applications can be divided into two categories by their reasons for use. The first type of applications are for 
		a widespread market and are general purpose applications, such as a word processor. The second type is for a niche 
		market and is designed for a certain type of organization or business. These are just three of the most common ways 
		applications are divided. <br> <br>Not all types of applications are productive to computer users. Malicious software is 
		used to gather information or gain access to private computer networks. Malware is the general term used to describe 
		a number of different types of malicious software however different kinds of malicious software perform different tasks. 
		Other names include viruses, ransomware, bugs, trojan horses and spyware. Many computer companies have developed 
		anti-virus software. The purpose of this software is to protect computers from malicious software. Many common types 
		of anti-virus software are Norton and McAfee. Many of these applications also deal with security on desktop computer 
		and mobile devices.
